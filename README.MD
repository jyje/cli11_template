# cli11_template
Simple template of C++ argument parser. [CLIUtils/CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) repository was used to make this template.

- Required: Build tools for C++ 11, at least
- Tested:
    - MSVC2022 in Windows 11
    - GCC 9.4.0 in Ubuntu 20.04

You can write CLI project with argument parser by copying this template. You should edit example methods of `Args` class as you want.
